# odin-rockpaperscissors

05/01/22

Getting started on JS with my first project in the language. I have previous experience in C, Java, Python, but not much, so I'm expecting this to be a great learning opportunity.

~1 hour later:

I have completed the project and shockingly seem to have no bugs no matter how many times I run it! I will now be adding additional checks to make sure the user can only input rock, paper, or scissors, but I'm very proud of how much I remembered and how quickly I was able to figure this one out.

~45 mins later:

I seemed to have rushed in haste past the actual intent of the project, which is to loop through a best-of-five game series and keep the score. There are still some minor changes I'd like to make, but the intent is there and I'm very happy with the results.
